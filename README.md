#Mastermind
===========
##Instructions:
Mastermind is a code-breaking game that helps develop deductive reasoning and logic by requiring players to deduce secret combinations of colors with minimal clues. After each of these chances, the computer must reveal how many colors are in the correct location, or the correct color in the incorrect location, or completely incorrect. With this little information, you must improve upon your previous guess to crack the code. You have 10 chances to guess the correct sequence before you lose the game.
